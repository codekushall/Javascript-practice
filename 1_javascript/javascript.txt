JavaScript is a programming language.

Data Types
- In javascript, datatype is the kind of value you store like number or text. DataType helps us to understand on what type of data we are using like numbers or test.There are different types of datatypes:
- integers/numbers(2,43,-23)
- floating numbers(1.22,34.2,-9.21)
- string("",'')
- symbol(@,#)
- BigInt(Used for those numbers which exceed the limit of number variable.(1.734632428373628473765n))
- Boolen (True or False)
- object (used for grouping different information like age,name,number)

Variables
-In Javascript, variables acts as a containers which stores the data that you can access and modify throughout the program.
-let(let is a type of variables which value can be changed throughout the program without any error. )
-const(const is a type of variables whose value can only be assigned onetime once the value is assigned it cannot be changed as in let.)

Strings
-In Javascript, strings are the sequence of characters which are used to store text data. It is one of the type of premitive data type along with integers,boolean,null and undefined.
-To create a String we can use SingleQuotes and DoubleDuotes.
-Strings are immutable in programing (immutable means once the value is assigned the value cannot be changed.)

String Concatenation
-In JavaScript, String Concatenation is the process of combing two or more texts together to form a single text,while coding text is essential part of coding so we need to combine texts and for that we need String Concatenation.
